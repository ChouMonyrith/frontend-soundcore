# Style AuthForm with Split Layout

The goal is to style the [AuthForm](file:///c:/Users/rithc/source/code/V2-SoundCore/soundcore-frontend/app/components/AuthForm.js#5-124) component to have a split layout with a background on the left and the form on the right.

## Proposed Changes

### Components

#### [MODIFY] [AuthForm.js](file:///c:/Users/rithc/source/code/V2-SoundCore/soundcore-frontend/app/components/AuthForm.js)

- Wrap the existing form in a full-screen flex container.
- Add a left section (50% width) with a background image ([/AuthBG.png](file:///c:/Users/rithc/source/code/V2-SoundCore/soundcore-frontend/public/AuthBG.png)).
- Add a right section (50% width) containing the form, centered.
- Enhance form styling for a premium look (spacing, shadows, etc.).

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification

- Run `npm run dev` (already running).
- Open the browser to `/sign-in` and `/sign-up`.
- Verify the split layout: background on left, form on right.
- Verify responsiveness (on smaller screens, the background might be hidden or the form takes full width).
